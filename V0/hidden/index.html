        <h1>Welcome to the Science Computing and Communication Group (SCCG)
        website.<br></h1>

        By 2005, more transistors were grown (~1018) than grains of rice,
        representing approximately 150 million transistors per human [1]. These
        transistors are omnipresent in the developed world, appearing primarily
        in the form of computing systems ranging in scale from the simple
        microcontroller that controls a toaster to the billions of transistors
        in each of the world's hundreds of millions of PCs. We already live
        among the machines. How can we live together more cooperatively?<br>
        <br>
        My work is focused on connecting people and machines from a physical
        and logical layer perspective, and allowing them to live and work
        cooperatively in the physical world. I explore this new frontier of
        computing through the design and field use of systems ranging from
        automated weather probes that communicate by satellite the weather on
        the South Col of Mt. Everest, to a system for tracking, classifying,
        and visualizing the motion of stage performers as they juggle, dance,
        and play musical instruments, and most recently the design of ultra-low
        power and cost RFID tags and readers for identifying and tracking
        millions of goods as they pass through the supply chain.<br>
        <br>
        The common technology thread is the acquisition, communication, and
        classification of the identity, state, and location of people and
        objects. I span the traditional boundary between analog and digital
        systems, and am beginning to tackle the boundary between the digital
        and biological worlds...<br>

<h2>Wireless Admitance Monitoring System (WiAMS)</h2>
<p><p><A title="Concrete |Z| analysis" href = "images/Wiams/concrete.png"  rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img src="images//Wiams/concrete.png" class="thumbnail" style="float:left;" height="100" width="150"/></A>The WiAMS is a wireless system for estimating the impedance magnitude (|Z|) of a PZT device that is utilized for concrete integrity monitoring. Particularly, WiAMS offers extensive features such as remote control, high processing power, wireless data upload to SQL database, email notifications, sched- uled, iterative |Z| estimations and frequency span from 5 kHz to 300 kHz resolution down to 1 Hz. A comprehensive report of the system can be found <a href="documents/wiams.pdf">here</a>. The project was developed together with George Pentes and John Agadakos.

<h2>Novel, Ultra Low Power, Low Cost, Scalable Backscatter Sensor Network for Measuring Relative Humidity (MSc Thesis)</h2>
<p><img src="images/bsn/bsn_out.jpg" class="thumbnail" style="float:left;" height="100" width="150"/> My master thesis regards the development of an ultra low-cost, ultra low-power and scalable sensor network, operating with bi-static backscatter principles. A wireless sensor tag that utilizes modulation via reflection has been developed. It achieves communication via the backscattering of a carrier emitted by an Silabs Si1000 radio in a tag-reader range of over 100m while consuming 0.5mW for transmission. The tag modulates relative environmental humidity (RH) with an 1.9%RH RMS error. Moreover, each tag implements a scalable frequency division multiple access scheme that allows development of large sensor networks. A video demonstration of a point-to-point link that demonstrates the communication range is available <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RNUTltxR4gM">here</a>. For the puposes of this work, we developed along with <a href="http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~ikimionis3/">John Kimionis</a> an  over-the-air programmable backscatter testbed is developed that utilizes the bootloader developed for my diploma thesis. A video demonstration of the setup is depicted <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ifCobSjKI4">here</a>.</br>

The system to be monitored is flexible and innovative magneto-rheometer has been designed and fabricated in the Mineral Resources Engineering Department (MRED) laboratory. It consists of a vertical pipe running across a magnetic field created by an electromagnet. The system is equipped with a coriolis flowmeter and three pressure transmitters. The flow is provided by a peristaltic pump. The pipes which carry the fluid are non-magnetic. The parameters which are monitored are flow rate, density, temperature, pressure, pressure drop and magnetic flux. For the analog to digital conversion of the monitored parameters, a data acquisiton card by National Instruments was utilized and a software script in Matlab was written in order to translate and present the data to the user. </br></br>

The vehicle is a toy-car equipped with a microphone, an acoustic bandpass filter and a C8051f320 Development Kit, interfaced to a CC2500 radio module. Location is estimated with the use of convex optimization algorithms running on a PC. The provided testbed is designed with low-cost, custom audio ranging electronics, RF communication and easy-to-use, Matlab interface that allows quick experimentation with various localization algorithms.</br>

Specifically, a modular multi-hop WSN has been built for temperature and soil wetness measurements, towards precision agriculture applications. The i-Cubes are radio communicating modules for low-cost sensing and information relaying. Moreover we have deployed a methodology for synchronized access with highly unsynchronized nodes, ensuring connectivity and reduced energy consumption. This work provides a concrete demonstration example of a simple precision agriculture application and could potentially assist students, researchers and practitioners to develop their own customized platforms, without dependence on commercial WSN platforms. Notice that the radio modules were thoroughly constructed in the telecommunications laboratory of the department, including the design of a customized printed circuit board.  </b>

<h2>RF Link for the Municipal Water Supply Company of Chania</h2>
<p><A title="Deyax Nodes" href = "images/deyax.jpg"  rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img src="images/deyax.jpg" class="thumbnail" style="float:left;" height="100" width="150"/></A>Together with <a href="http://www.prism.gatech.edu/~ikimionis3/">John Kimionis</a> , we implemented a point-to-point RF link for the Municipal Water Supply Company of Chania. Water tank level data from a already-installed sensor had to be transmitted wirelessly to the Company's facilities, as there was no infrastructure for current-loop cables installation. The distance between the two nodes utilized was about 450 meters.
One wireless node served as the transmitter, utilizing on-chip Analog to Digital Converter and simple circuitry to acquire sensor data. The information was transmitted to a second node, which output the sensor's measured value on a digital port. A custom Digital to Analog Converter was built, plus a Voltage Controlled Current Source, to achieve output of 4-20mA current values, in order to ensure compatibility with the Company's PLC units. Protocol-specific functions were implemented, such as alerts of broken link and/or sensor, in the form of 0mA output current.

The nodes along with the respective circuitry were packaged in high quality waterproof IP65 boxes to prevent dust and water from affecting the electronics.</p>

	<p><A title= href = "images/thesis_demo.jpg"  rel="lightbox[roadtrip]"><img src="images/thesis_demo.jpg" class="thumbnail" style="float:left;" height="100" width="150"/></A>During my diploma thesis, I developed hardware, middleware and software towards a custom and low-cost remotely programmable radio network testbed. Such testbed is envisioned as a tool for the telecom researcher to develop, deploy and debug radio network projects and applications. To the best of the my knowledge, this is the first attempt towards a radio network testbed, designed and built in a Greek university from first principles. Key features of the testbed include: simplicity of use, reliability and remote programmability. Furthermore, each carefully designed wireless transceiver node enables environmental sensing and personal computer interfacing at a relatively low cost (\euro{30} bill of materials for each transceiver assuming relatively small quantities), due to in-house design and fabrication. The proposed testbed consists of various software and hardware components designed to facilitate experimental work for the telecom engineer/researcher. You can find my thesis text
